title: Typescript - from any to unknown
date: 2023-08-15
description: In this presentation, we seek to understand the differences between Typescript's "any" and "unknown" types. We'll learn when to use which, and the common pitfalls that come with using the wrong one. Finally, we'll investigate how to create and use Typescript's "is" functions to compliment type inference.
