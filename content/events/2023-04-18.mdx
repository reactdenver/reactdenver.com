title: React Denver - Level up your docs site with Next.js + MDX
date: 2023-04-18
description: Are you looking for a simple yet efficient way to build a stunning documentation or blog website? Let's see what we can accomplish by combining the best-in-class developer experience of Next.js, with MDX—a library which brings markdown and more to JSX. If you need a bit more customizability than tools like Docusaurus or Gitbook, or if you're already using Next.js as part of your stack, this combo could be what you're looking for.
